# chimpTest
Based on the chimp test where buttons labeled by numbers 1 to N are displayed across the screen, users are then given time to memorise and the numbers are then hidden, each button must then be pressed in order to complete the level. Each level gets progressively harder with the addition of new numbers. Makes use of react an bootstrap libraries.
